# FitRaho App
This is an app-demo showcase in my college in a subject based around building a project which adds to your CV which is unironically known as "Minor Project - II".

### Pre-requisites to view the app (Things you would need before viewing)
You would need the following:
1. An Android or iOS smartphone with a working Camera good enough to scan a QR code.
2. Expo GO App must be downloaded on the said smartphone.
3. A Laptop or Desktop (hereafter called "PC") where this code is open in some code editor (like VS Code)
4. Singular WiFi or Mobile Hotspot connection to which BOTH the smartphone and the PC are connected.
5. A fairly fast connection speed in the WiFi or Mobile Hotspot used.
6. The Zip file of this project (Node Modules must be downloaded separately) downloaded and unzipped in the desired location in your PC

### How to view the demo of this app?
You would first need to open the code editor of your choice (Example: We used VS Code throughout the project).
Even if you are on Ubuntu and you are using Text Editor to view the files (i.e., do not have a code editor installed) you will need to open the Terminal and navigate to your directory or open the directory with the Terminal.

Now, we need to run the command `npm start` which will start the program.
The Terminal (in its output) would generate a QR code. Using the Expo GO app, you would need to scan the QR to view the application on your phone. 

NOTE:
No guarantees of responsive design (i.e., the design fitting perfectly to your specific phone's screen is not exactly guaranteed. It may work in most cases with occassional alphabet or word drops)
